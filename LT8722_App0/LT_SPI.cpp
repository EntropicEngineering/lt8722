LT_SPI: Routines to communicate with ATMEGA328P's hardware SPI port.

@verbatim

LT_SPI implements the low level master SPI bus routines using
the hardware SPI port.

SPI Frequency=(CPU Clock frequency)/(16+2(TWBR)*Prescaler)
SPCR = SPI Control Register (SPIE SPE DORD MSTR CPOL CPHA SPR1 SPR0)
SPSR = SPI Status Register (SPIF WCOL - - - - - SPI2X)

Data Modes:
CPOL  CPHA  Leading Edge    Trailing Edge
0      0    sample rising   setup falling
0      1    setup rising    sample falling
1      0    sample falling  setup rising
1      1    sample rising   setup rising

CPU Frequency = 16Mhz on Arduino Uno
SCK Frequency
SPI2X  SPR1  SPR0  Frequency  Uno_Frequency
  0      0     0     fosc/4     4 Mhz
  0      0     1     fosc/16    1 Mhz
  0      1     0     fosc/64    250 khz
  0      1     1     fosc/128   125 khz
  0      0     0     fosc/2     8 Mhz
  0      0     1     fosc/8     2 Mhz
  0      1     0     fosc/32    500 khz
